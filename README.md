# Handwritten Digits Recognition with OCR and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Handwritten Digits Recognition with OCR and KNN project. This practical project is a part of an online OCR (Optical Character Recognition) course and focuses on the exciting field of handwritten digits recognition using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and OpenCV.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore the application of OCR technology to recognize and classify handwritten digits. Handwritten digit recognition has numerous real-world applications, from postal services automating zip code recognition to banking institutions processing handwritten checks.
